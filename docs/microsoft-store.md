# Publishing to the Microsoft Store

Satchel goes to the Store as an **MSIX** package. The Store signs MSIX packages itself after certification, so this needs no code-signing certificate, and Store installs update automatically. Packaging runs on GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/microsoft-store.yml`), so no Windows machine is needed to publish.

## One-time setup

1. **Partner Center account.** Sign up at [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/registration) as an individual or a company. Registration is free for both.
2. **Reserve the name.** In *Apps and games*, choose *New product* > *MSIX or PWA app* and reserve **Satchel**. If the name is taken, reserve another one and set it as `MSSTORE_DISPLAY_NAME` (step 4).
3. **Copy the package identity.** Open the app > *Product management* > *Product identity* and copy:
   - `Package/Identity/Name`, e.g. `12345Publisher.Satchel`
   - `Package/Identity/Publisher`, e.g. `CN=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`
   - `Package/Properties/PublisherDisplayName`
4. **Repository variables.** In GitHub, open *Settings* > *Secrets and variables* > *Actions* > *Variables* and add:

   | Variable | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `MSSTORE_IDENTITY_NAME` | Package/Identity/Name |
   | `MSSTORE_PUBLISHER` | Package/Identity/Publisher |
   | `MSSTORE_PUBLISHER_DISPLAY_NAME` | Package/Properties/PublisherDisplayName |
   | `MSSTORE_DISPLAY_NAME` | Only when the reserved name isn't "Satchel" |

   None of these is secret: they are printed in the package itself.

## Building a package

Publishing a GitHub release builds its package. You can also build one at any time from *Actions* > *Microsoft Store* > *Run workflow*: leave *tag* empty for the latest release, and leave *submit* unchecked to only build. When the run finishes, download the **msix-microsoft-store** artifact: a zip holding `Satchel_X.Y.Z.0_x64.msix`.

To package code that isn't released yet, fill in *branch* instead (e.g. `master`): it builds that branch of this repository as **msix-branch-build**. The workflow never submits it, but you can upload it in Partner Center by hand, as long as its version is higher than the one in the Store. To install it locally first, it needs a signature (see *Good to know*).

Two versioning rules apply:

- The package version is the app version from `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` with a `.0` appended. The Store reserves that fourth part.
- Every submission needs a higher version than the last one.

If the artifact is called **msix-placeholder-identity-not-for-upload**, the variables weren't set. That run only checked that packaging works.

## First submission

In Partner Center, open the app and start a submission:

1. **Pricing and availability:** Free, and the markets to publish in.
2. **Properties:**
   - **Category:** *Developer tools*.
   - **Privacy policy URL:** point it to [`PRIVACY.md`](../PRIVACY.md) on GitHub. It's required because the app connects to the network.
   - **Support contact:** the repository's issues page works.
3. **Age ratings:** the questionnaire. It's a developer tool with no user-generated content shared between users.
4. **Packages:** upload the `.msix` and keep the *Desktop* device family.
5. **Store listings:**
   - A description, at least one screenshot (1366×768 or larger) and search terms.
   - The app icon comes from the package.
6. **Submission options > Restricted capabilities:** the package declares `runFullTrust`, like any packaged desktop app. The field takes at most 500 characters; this text fits:

   > Satchel is a Win32 desktop app (Rust + WebView2) packaged as MSIX; runFullTrust is required for its Windows.FullTrustApplication entry point. It uses it to send the HTTP requests the user builds to any host, localhost included, and to read and write the workspace files and folders the user picks. No admin rights, drivers, services or telemetry.

   From the version with git workspaces on, add before the last sentence: *It also runs the user's own git to sync a workspace, and keeps secret variables in Windows Credential Manager.* The full text still fits in 500 characters.

7. Submit. Certification usually takes from a few hours to three business days.

## Updates

Once the app is live, the workflow submits each new release by itself. The new submission copies the last one, so the listing, pricing and the rest stay as they are; only the package changes. Certification follows as usual, and Store installs update themselves once it passes.

A release reaches the Store when its GitHub release is published, not when its tag is pushed. Releases start as drafts, and the Store gets them only when they go public.

### Setting up automatic submissions

1. **A Microsoft Entra tenant.** In Partner Center, open *Account settings* > *Tenants*. Associate the tenant you already have, or create a new one there. A new tenant is free.
2. **An Entra app.** In *Account settings* > *User management* > *Microsoft Entra applications*, add a new app and give it the **Manager** role. Then create a key for it and copy the **client secret** right away, because it's shown only once. The same page shows the app's **tenant ID** and **client ID**.
3. **Seller ID.** Find it in *Account settings*, under *Legal info* > *Developer* or *Identifiers*, depending on the account.
4. **Store ID.** Find it in the app > *Product management* > *Product identity*. It looks like `9N...`.
5. **In GitHub**, open *Settings* > *Secrets and variables* > *Actions*:

   | Kind | Name | Value |
   |---|---|---|
   | Secret | `MSSTORE_TENANT_ID` | Tenant ID |
   | Secret | `MSSTORE_SELLER_ID` | Seller ID |
   | Secret | `MSSTORE_CLIENT_ID` | Client ID |
   | Secret | `MSSTORE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Client secret |
   | Variable | `MSSTORE_PRODUCT_ID` | Store ID |
   | Variable | `MSSTORE_SOURCE_REPO` | Only in a fork: the repository whose releases to follow, e.g. `matheuscaet/satchel` |

6. **Mark what's already in the Store.** Each submitted release is marked with an `msstore/vX.Y.Z` tag, so it's sent only once. A version you submitted by hand has no mark yet. Push one for it, or the schedule will try to submit that version again:

   ```bash
   git tag msstore/v1.0.0 && git push origin msstore/v1.0.0
   ```

### When a release is picked up

- **In the repository that makes the releases,** publishing one starts the build right away.
- **In a fork,** `MSSTORE_SOURCE_REPO` points to the upstream repository. Its releases don't trigger anything in the fork, so a run every six hours looks for a new one.
  - The schedule only runs from the fork's default branch.
  - GitHub turns schedules off in a public repository after 60 days without activity. It warns by email first, and *Actions* > *Microsoft Store* > *Enable workflow* turns it back on.

### When a submission fails

A submission fails while the previous one is still in certification, or when the version isn't higher than the one in the Store. Nothing is marked in that case, so the next scheduled run tries again. To resend a release that is already marked, run the workflow by hand with *submit* checked.

## Good to know

- **The app's own workspace lives apart from the MSI/EXE install.** Windows keeps a packaged app's `AppData` separately, so the Store version doesn't see the workspace an installer version kept in the app, and the other way round. Workspace files and folders on disk are shared by both: save the workspace to a file or folder in one, and open it in the other.
- **WebView2.** The package relies on the WebView2 runtime that ships with Windows 11, and with Microsoft Edge on Windows 10.
- **Only x64 for now.** Windows on Arm runs x64 apps under emulation. A native Arm64 package can be added with `-Arch arm64` and an `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` build.
- **Installing a package outside the Store.** A package has to be signed before Windows installs it. To try one locally before submitting, sign it with a self-signed certificate whose subject matches `MSSTORE_PUBLISHER`, then trust that certificate on the test machine. [Microsoft's guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/msix/package/sign-app-package-using-signtool) covers both steps. The Store's own certification also runs the app before it's published.
